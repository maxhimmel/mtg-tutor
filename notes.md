# Issues:

1. The suggested decks have incorrect spell counts when including the Evolving Wilds/multi-colored lands. Those 2 card types should detract from the 17-lands count.

2. I did a draft and went wide with my color choices because I was focusing on dragon synergies, but it kept complaining that I should solidify my color choice.

# Ideas:

1. A quiz on what card a certain mono-colored card could/should belong to.

- Ex. This Red card belongs in a Boros deck because ... <x,y,z>.
- The important bit is that it'd teach me what the archetypes even are, and what monocolored cards fit the type to belong in that archetype.

# Deferred (from Draft Review grilling, 2026-07-21):

Out-of-scope for the Draft Review MVP, noted so we don't lose them:

1. Deep multi-ply permutation re-simulation (chess.com-style alternate lines —
   replay the whole draft down a different branch). The MVP stores the RNG seed
   specifically to keep this possible later without a retrofit.
2. Longitudinal review-quiz trend tracking (persist each quiz outcome + add stats
   panels showing judgment improvement over time). Natural 2nd iteration once the
   review loop feels right; MVP only shows a session score.
3. Standalone archetype quiz — see Ideas #1 above. Separate command / data model,
   not part of reviewing a draft.
4. Keep review logic UI-agnostic in `core/` for an eventual React frontend (e.g.
   expose the decision-pick threshold as a slider to the user).
